        <p>Grown Ups is loaded with behavior that real grown-ups would be well-advised to avoid. That said, there’s more heart here than you might expect.</p>

        <p>When the five friends arrive at the funeral, their lives are in various states of disarray. Lenny, a successful Hollywood agent, finds that his kids are turning into pampered freaks, unable to drink water unless it’s imported from Norway or pull themselves away from their violent video games. Eric’s eldest daughter throws fits if someone asks her to eat cake with a fork, and his 4-year-old son is still suckling from his mother’s breast. Kurt is an unappreciated househusband, it’s not clear if Rob’s married to a woman or just a fetish, and Marcus—unfettered by anything but casual sex and bottles of booze—never even tried to stop being an adolescent.</p>

        <p>To say these old chums all have life-changing experiences during their time together is, perhaps, too kind. But for Lenny, the statement isn’t too far off. He forces his sons to punt their cell phones and put away their screen games so he can teach them the simple joys of skipping rocks and barreling down waterslides. He starts acting, in short, like a dad—and a pretty decent one at that.</p>

        <p>At the end of the movie, Lenny and his son take on Dickie Bailey (one of Lenny’s childhood adversaries) and his boy in a game of basketball. Lenny—the rich, successful agent—finds himself in position to make the winning shot—but he doesn’t. He purposely misses, opening the door for put-upon, blue-collar Dickie to take the match. Lenny’s son absorbs the loss philosophically—a remarkable turnaround from the spoiled brat we initially meet—saying he’ll practice more at home so they can win the rematch.</p>

        <p>When Lenny’s wife asks him why he missed the shot, Lenny says, “The Baileys needed to learn how to win every once in a while. And the Feders needed to learn how to lose.”</p>

        <p>Other families draw benefit from their time together, too. Eric’s son starts drinking milk from a carton. Kurt patches things up with his wife. And all of them build up their long-term friendships that may last the rest of their lives. This one is one of the best movies I've watched since I was a kid, a pure comedic sketch if you don't take it too seriously.</p>
