        <p>The cute factor in Netflix’s anime film “A Whisker Away” is bountiful enough, even if its love story of naive obsession is a little more than worrisome. One could say this is about the delusions of puppy love, but aha, they'd be wrong—"A Whisker Away" is all about cats.</p>

        <p>In this film from directors Junichi Satoh and Tomotaka Shibayama, a girl named Miyo (Mirai Shida) turns into a cat whenever she wants to be close to Hinode (Natsuki Hanae), a young boy who doesn't share her same level of infatuation. But she can still get close to Hinode, and watch him work on pottery with his grandfather, by putting on a cat mask that instantly turns her into a white kitty with glacier-blue eyes. Thinking that the cat is a friendly stray, Hinode even names this cat after his beloved old pet Taro, a gesture among many that makes Miyo silently swoon.</p>

        <p>This premise was fused to a philosophy that stayed consistent from film to film. Something like: the kaiju don't hate us. They don't even mean us harm (though they do enjoy a human snack now and then). They're animals jockeying for dominance, over territory and each other. If we hadn't treated Earth like a toilet for centuries, they would've stayed beasts of song and legend, talked about but never seen.</p>

        <p>The villain of this story is a cat known as Mask Seller, who gives Miyo the ability to transform in a rushed opening scene. Always with a big grin on his face, Mask Seller is a mighty chunky, back-flipping, scene-stealing tabby that would make a killing on Instagram, but instead harvests the souls of cats and humans alike. When Miyo foolishly decides that she wants to stay in cat form in order to be close to Hinode and escape her buried woes (like the trauma of her mother abandoning her), Mask Seller does not dissuade her from it. </p>

        <p>In all of its equal whimsy and romance, “A Whisker Away” has plenty of lessons—or depending on the audience, reminders—that it wants to impart. Namely, that a human wouldn’t want to trade lives with a cat, even if your crush seems to embrace you more in cat-form. And as it works through Miyo’s immaturity, the progressively clever script looks at Miyo's actions from the perspectives of others, as people realize that her exuberance is its own mask for her pain. But this film being as blunt with dialogue as it is, it also has a faceless teacher talk during a throwaway class moment about how “we can’t ever really know someone’s full emotion,” just in case we miss the way the third act underlines and puts it in bold later. </p>
