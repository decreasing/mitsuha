        <p>One of the most highly anticipated horror movies of the summer is Nia DaCosta’s Candyman. The movie co-written and produced by Get Out’s Jordan Peele will continue a story that began with Tony Todd’s terrifying hook-hand and mouth full of bees in a modern take on the story that is grounded in real events and continues to be relevant today. After a round of delays, the spiritual sequel to the 1992 original is scheduled to be coming this summer.</p>

        <p>To get ready for what’s in store for the horror movie, let’s talk about Candyman’s origins and notable plot lines and discuss how the 2021 movie could forward the franchise. Get out of sight from any nearby bathroom mirrors, and get ready to get into everything you need to know about the upcoming Candyman movie:</p>

        <p>In the Candyman movie, the “Candyman” is a man named Daniel Robitaille, the son of a former slave. In 1890, Daniel is an established painter who gets commissioned to paint a portrait of a wealthy white woman named Caroline Sullivan, who he falls in love with on the job. Through their forbidden affair, Caroline gets pregnant, and in her father’s anger, he gathers a lynch mob, who cuts off Daniel’s right hand and smears honey all over his body. He was stung to death and as the film’s urban legend goes, if you recite “Candyman” in the mirror five times, the ghost of Daniel will appear behind you and kill you with his bloody hook hand. He also torments those who question his existence. He is immortal, but there is a mirror that apparently holds his soul and if it is destroyed he will cease to exist.</p>

        <p>Candyman’s legend is partly inspired from a 1985 short story called “The Forbidden,” by Clive Barker. Except in “The Forbidden,” the Candyman is a white man who wears a patchwork outfit and haunts the slums of England, rather than Chicago’s Cabrini-Green housing projects. The story could also be inspired in part by the Bloody Mary folklore, which similarly conjures a deadly figure after repeating a name in a mirror.</p>

        <p>The character of Helen Lyle kind of represents the fear surrounding housing projects, and the class divide between the wealthy white class and the world of impoverished black communities. Helen spends the entirety of the movie seeking to understand and empathize with the Candyman legend, and as the movie argues, in order to come the closest to that is to die for it and wallow in the Candyman’s haunted fate. Helen’s own immortal vengeance can never be as poignant as the pain of Daniel Robitaille’s origins, but at the time of the film’s release it was seen as a powerful ending.</p>

        <p>What’s interesting about the spiritual sequel is how its new main character will share a love of visual art like the Candyman, along with carrying the weight of being a Black man, though in another generation from Candyman. The original Candyman Tony Todd is set to reprise his role, and it is rumored that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II will become the Candyman somehow. Helen Lyle’s origins will also play a definite role in the upcoming horror film.</p>

        <p>Candyman certainly has a rich and relevant history that will undoubtedly be important to know going into Nia DaCosta’s take on the horror property. After a number of delays, the movie is expected to come out this August 27 in theaters. It’s unclear whether the film will spawn more sequels, but the movie could perhaps usher in a new generation to the storyline and continue.
