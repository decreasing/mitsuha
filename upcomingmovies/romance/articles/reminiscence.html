        <p>Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman), a private investigator of the mind, navigates the darkly alluring world of the past by helping his clients access lost memories. Living on the fringes of the sunken Miami coast, his life is forever changed when he takes on a new client, Mae (Rebecca Ferguson). A simple matter of lost and found becomes a dangerous obsession. As Bannister fights to find the truth about Mae's disappearance, he uncovers a violent conspiracy, and must ultimately answer the question: how far would you go to hold on to the ones you love?</p>

<p>The Warner Bros. film, which co-stars Thandie Newton and Rebecca Ferguson, will also begin rolling out internationally on August 25, 2021. The studio announced that the film was part of its plans to release several big-screen productions on HBO Max concurrent with their theatrical bows, but did not say when it would open. “Westworld” co-creator Lisa Joy wrote, directed and co-produced “Reminiscence.” Jackman announced the official release date on his social media channels.</p>

<p>WarnerMedia has been looking to bolster interest in the streaming service, which faces fierce competition from the likes of Disney Plus and Netflix. Moving its entire 2021 film slate has certainly gotten a lot of attention for the service even as it has led to some criticism from filmmakers.</p> 

<p>In addition to Joy, “Reminiscence” was produced by Jonathan Nolan, Michael De Luca and Aaron Ryder. The rest of the cast includes Cliff Curtis, Marina de Tavira, Daniel Wu, Mojean Aria, Brett Cullen, Natalie Martinez, Angela Sarafyan and Nico Parker.</p>
