        <p>When it comes to Anime I am as general public as its possible to be.  All my years of learning and study mean zip because I have never engaged with Animation, no Mickey, no comics, perhaps some remains of Astro Boy though.  After seeing Demon Slayer-Kimetsu No Yaiba-The Movie: Mugen Train, that might have to change.  What an extraordinary artwork!  I attended the screening because I thought it was important to see Japan’s highest grossing feature film of all time, but this remarkable offering has left me schooled and desperate to know more.</p>

<p>Since going down a google hole after the viewing I have a deeper understanding of the mythology and history but let’s just chat through what I saw.  Tanjiro is a gutsy young man who has completed some Demon Slayer Corps training and is requested to join Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku on a train where humans have been disappearing.  He has with him Nezuko, his sister who was turned into a demon but fights for humans after returning, and Zenitsu who has fair skin and blonde hair and Inosuke who wears a boar’s head as part of his modified outfit.  Don’t stacks-on me if that’s not perfect! </p>

<p>This group will fight an especially nasty and crafty demon who … well I don’t want to say because this film will have you on the edge of your seat when its true diabolical plot is revealed. There’s also another adversary about whom I will say nothing except … that fight sequence had my heart racing badly.</p> 

<p>What about this brilliant film makes one so suddenly curious?  For me it begins in the voice work.  The very first scene has a vocal performance which carries the ancient and venerable weight of care and concern for youth.  And the acting throughout continues to express the emotions, and action, with absolute clarity.  There’s oofs and ahhs in the fights, and the weeping, a surprising amount of it, is just so moving and characterful.  It took a while for my uneducated viewing brain to absorb the depth of detail in the images but when the young woman speaks to the Master in that first scene, the lips don’t move but the eyes blink and the viewer writes upon her face their own empathy.  2 minutes in and I can’t tear my eyes away. </p>

<p>And speaking of eyes, later in the film, when the characters are put to sleep you can see their REM movement.  Oh, the detail!   As I began to fully appreciate the superb drawings, the ‘drone’ shot of the train alone is a cell I could have framed on a wall, there was also the abstracted to assimilate.  Colours clashing and cutaways to inside-the-head craziness and size changes as Tanjiro is in awe of Rengoku are all part of the beauty of the more surrealist renderings. 

	Presented in Japanese with English subtitles one can get the real flavour of the plot and characters. ‘That was awesome, Bro’ and ‘You’ve got to be kidding me!’ says a lot when you hear it in its original styling.  The Foley sound effects are not just katana drawn from saya (I looked that up!).  Feet on ice and the chilling sound of demon growth and transmogrification are an essential part of the evocative soundscape.  I also appreciated the way the text of the film gives an inner voice which explains events – ‘If need to …’.  And out-loud calling upon their powers also makes the mythical accessible to someone who doesn’t know the lore. ‘Tenth Form, Water Breathing’ and ‘Beast Breathing, Fifth Form’.
	
	The story hurtles along with action and inner turmoil for our brave hero, the constant sacrifice he makes will break your heart. There has been so much to take in since experiencing this film that I have been on a bit of a high and after witnessing Tanjiro’s moral and physical courage had a desire to be a better person.  If the spiritual core of humanity, superbly conceptualised by the film, is protected by our better instincts surely we can tussle injustice as Tanjiro and his friends do evil incarnated.</p>
	
<p>If Demon Slayer-Kimetsu No Yaiba-The Movie: Mugen Train has been an eye opening experience for me, it is also an entry drug of sorts.  See it for the thrill of superlative filmmaking and the fact that it has been 12 straight weeks at #1 at the Japanese box office, but I bet you’ll want more.</p>
