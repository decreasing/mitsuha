        <p>This is a great little movie, a fun, heartfelt and entertaining diversion for 90 minutes. It’s typical shonen big screen fare in that when it comes to the main story, this is just a high quality instalment of filler. Just as in the Naruto and Bleach films, it’s about the characters and this specific story, not about the overall narrative, and that is just what you’d expect. Blue Exorcist’s little bit of filler is a really good story though, one that puts me in mind of the first Bleach movie, Memories of Nobody. That was an emotional and moving story featuring the Bleach characters and a one-off guest character, but the story was well written and the performances were so engaging, that for me, it actually elevated the movie over the series. The Blue Exorcist movie does much the same thing, taking the Blue Exorcist characters and introducing a guest character, crafting a story that tugs at the heartstrings first and foremost.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t elevate the movie over the series, but then again, that was Bleach, and this is Blue Exorcist. I also feel that this film really works best as a standalone, and that fans of the series and the manga might come away feeling a little let down when their favourite cast members have little more than a glorified cameo. But this is a short film, and it focuses on the story it wants to tell. It’s really about Rin and the little demon child that he discovers, Usamaro, and to a lesser extent Yukio and the visiting exorcist from Taiwan, Cheng Long Liu. The rest of the cast either have background supporting roles, or brief cameos. But the important thing is that the film tells its story efficiently, and without added padding to detract from the emotional intent.</p>

        <p>You’d think that in a story about demons, engendering audience empathy would be difficult, but the initial fairy tale of a benevolent demon child sets the tone of the film, with their father wondering what Yukio and Rin would do in a similar situation. Then, when we meet Usamaro, he turns out to be the cutest demon you can imagine, which is no surprise given that he’s voiced by Rie Kugimiya in the Japanese version. It’s another shonen trope that the hero is always going against the flow, forging his own path. Blue Exorcist’s hero Rin, the son of Satan established his contrary nature when he decided to become an exorcist to kick his ‘dad’s’ butt. The story in this movie kicks off when he and Shiemi act contrarily to Exorcist principles by trying to save lost souls when they should have just dealt with the phantom train.</p>

        <p>That error of judgement sets forth the train of events in the story when they discover Usamaro. Not only are they punished with 5 days suspension, but when Rin balks at simply sealing Usamaro away again, seeing the child as innocent and undeserving of punishment, he gets to look after him while he’s on suspension. For the exorcists, it means keeping Usamaro in a cage and occasionally feeding him. For Rin, it means letting him out, and bonding with him, and playing with him too. The initially feral and fearful Usamaro soon warms to Rin, and he also captures the hearts of Rin’s friends. The problem arises with Usamaro’s powers. He may be innocent and loveable, but he loves to play, and he wants his new friends to be happy too, and he can make all their pains and problems go away.</p>

        <p>The trouble is that it’s how people face their problems and adversities that shape their characters. Forgetting these things means forgetting responsibilities, and while it might be fun to forget and enjoy the festival, The True Cross Academy still has problems with protecting the school city, and dealing with more malevolent demons. It also falls to Rin to teach Usamaro about what it means to be human, but by then it’s almost too late. The lump in the throat ending to the film is inevitable.</p>

        <p>It’s a fun movie if you haven’t seen Blue Exorcist before, you don’t really need the intricate back-story to enjoy the film, and it’s the sweet and moving relationship that develops between Rin and Usamaro that holds the attention. But devoted Blue Exorcist fans might feel the lack of Ryuji, Renzo, Konekomaru and Izumi, might wish that Shura has a bigger part (fnar), although the three stooges do have an entertaining running gag about a balloon demon that keeps on bursting. The Blue Exorcist movie is a delightful way to spend 90 minutes, and this Blu-ray brings the film to home video in the best possible way.</p>
