        <p>In the weeks leading up to the season 1 finale, there were reports that a domain was registered for a Jujutsu Kaisen movie.

        This was confirmed only hours before the finale aired on March 26th, with the announcement that a movie by the title of ‘Jujutsu Kaisen 0’ will be produced by MAPPA.

        So, what date do we expect the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie to release internationally and how can you watch it around the world?

      At the time of writing, the ‘Jujutsu Kaisen 0’ movie is set to release in Winter 2021, but a specific release date has not been confirmed.
      Whilst it has been announced that Jujutsu Kaisen 0 will release this Winter, a more accurate date has not been confirmed.

      However, fans should remember that this Winter 2021 release date will likely only concern the films theatrical release in Japan.

      If this is correct, then the Jujutsu Kaisen movie will likely release theatrically around the world between two and five months after the national premiere in Japan.

      At an early prediction, the film may release in Japan during late-November or early-December 2021, before arriving internationally in March or April 2022.  </p>

        <p>It has been officially confirmed that Jujutsu Kaisen 0 will adapt the prequel story to the anime series, titled ‘Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School’.

        Per the Jujutsu Kaisen Fandom page, the movie will adapt the Cursed Child Arc. The story here is about a young boy called Yuta Okkotsu, who is haunted by his childhood friend Rika.

        Rika’s spirit has been cursed and turns into a cursed-entity that mercilessly kills anyone who she deems a threat to Yuta.

        Yuta is convinced to join Jujutsu High by Satoru Gojo and begins to train in Jujutsu sorcery, “alongside his new peers: Maki Zenin, a Cursed Tools user, Toge Inumaki, a Cursed Speech user, and Panda, a seemingly talking panda bear.”</p>
