        <p>"Zack Snyder's Justice League" runs four hours and two minutes. That's 242 minutes. That's longer than "Avatar," "Avengers: Endgame," "The Irishman," "Dances with Wolves," "Malcolm X," "Lawrence of Arabia," or any of the "Godfather" movies. If it were released to big screens, it would tie Kenneth Branagh's 1996 adaptation of "Hamlet" for being the longest major studio theatrical release in history.</p>

<p>And reader, if it ever does get released to theaters, I'll go see it again, just as long as it's in IMAX and there's an intermission. </p>

<p>Some other time, perhaps, we can talk more about the road that led to this moment, along with its implications for the major studio relationships to the more entitled or belligerent elements in fandom. My own feelings are summed up in the Clickhole headline, "The worst person you know just made a great point." Bottom line: I don't see how it's possible to put this version of the project next to the 2017 version and not recognize that it's superior in every way. </p> 

<p>This four-hour cut is the kind of brazen auteurist vision that Martin Scorsese was calling for when he complained (rightly) that most modern superhero movies don't resemble cinema as he's always understood and valued it. </p>

<p>The backstory: "Justice League" was meant to be the third in a series of Zack Snyder superhero films after "Man of Steel" and "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice," but Snyder and his chief collaborator and wife, executive producer Deborah Snyder, stepped down during postproduction to grieve for their daughter, who had died unexpectedly. The releasing studio, Warner Bros., was already pressuring the Snyders to add humor, following the relative box-office disappointment of the figuratively and literally funereal "Batman v. Superman," which ended with Superman's death. Joss Whedon (writer/director of the first two "Avengers" films) was brought in to take the project over the finish line, contain the running time to two hours, and make sure things were kept light. Whedon ended up rewriting and reshooting most of the movie, Whedon-izing it with deadpan quips and shooting new action scenes that, while competent, lacked the turbocharged delirium Snyder is known for. According to some behind-the-scenes accounts, less than 20% of what ended up in the final release was directed by Snyder.

	The recut—it feels more correct to call it a "restoration"—contains zero Whedon footage. It's broken into seven chapters with titles, each of which has a serene self-contained quality, reminiscent of issues of a monthly comic (as well as old-fashioned episodic television; the Snyder Cut is as much of a medium-blurring, "Is it TV or is it a movie?" project as "WandaVision," "Small Axe," and season three of "Twin Peaks"). Only a sliver of what's onscreen is wholly new, notably a forward-looking "teaser" conversation between Batman and the Joker; but Snyder generated so much material originally—much of it shelved by Warner Bros. without being properly finished by visual effects artists—that the totality still feels like a new work.
	
	There's no point getting deep into the weeds of a scene-by-scene comparison because the Snyder cult will surely cover it in 9/11 Commission detail, and because there's no longer any compelling reason to watch the Whedon cut (which I liked more than most viewers) beyond mere curiosity. The first version was a Frankenstein-patchwork "rescue mission" meant to fulfill studio notes—one of which, "more humor," seems redundant in retrospect. This cut has plenty of funny bits, ranging from the dry reactive glances and self-lacerating remarks of Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman; to the workplace anxiety of chief villain Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds), who is basically a razor-armored middle manager on probation with his nephew/boss, Darkseid (Ray Porter); to the Jeff Goldblum/Bill Murray-style, character-as-sportscaster commentary of Barry Allen/Flash (Ezra Miller); to the visual wit of Snyder's direction, particularly in scenes where the Flash perceives time being slowed-down and we get to watch as he rearranges the universe item by item, like a fussy chef re-plating every meal at a banquet just before the staff wheels it out to the guests. </p>
	
<p>The Whedon cut favored Bruce Wayne/Batman and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and marginalized Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill), Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Barry Allen/The Flash, and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher). This cut is an ensemble picture that does as good a job as MCU's "Avengers" films of depicting a band of heroes as strong-willed, fully-rounded individuals who had lives and issues before the main action started and must learn to work to together (in service of battling Steppenwolf and Darkseid and resurrecting Superman/Clark Kent). </p>
