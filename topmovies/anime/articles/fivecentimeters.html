        <p>The first episode takes us through Takaki’s perspective and his thoughts about his relationship with Akari, who recently transferred to Takaki’s elementary school in Tokyo. Sharing similar circumstances, they become close friends, and in time, inseparable. However, before their graduation, Akari announces that she has to move away. Less than a year later, Takaki also has to move away with his family, their distance growing further. With not much time left, they decide to meet up.</p>

        <p>The day of the meeting was something else. You could feel the excitement and nervousness as Takaki was on the train on his way to meet her. The snowy weather caused some delays and he loses the letter he wanted to give her. When they meet, the feelings they shared were unforgettable: heart-warming but painful, as they both knew that this would be their last meeting…They shared their first kiss, spent the night together side by side, and felt their final moments together with the rising sun… How hard can life be sometimes…Saying goodbye to the one you love, especially in a situation that’s out of your control, is one of the hardest things to go through, and in this case, at such a young age…Takaki boards the train home and promises to keep in contact. As the doors close, the taste of suffering and regret surges…</p>

        <p>In the second episode, the story’s point of view shifts to a girl named Sumida Kanae, a classmate of Takaki’s at a high school in Kagoshima. Kanae’s been in love with Takaki since he transferred to her junior-high-school. Her goal has been to get closer to Takaki, and in time, to be able to express her feelings for him. The story takes a sad turn…Takaki throughout the episode is depressed and emotionless. He is always looking in the distance for something; he is passive in all his conversations with Kanae; he is writing texts to himself and he is having dreams about Akari…This guy is a lost cause…It was really frustrating to see him like this, but to be honest, it felt like he was trying to get over it by spending time with Kanae and trying to live in present, but in the end he couldn’t get over his loss. Surely, I empathize, but this is just too much…Meanwhile, Kanae continues trying her best to get close to him, waiting for him after school to walk home together, greeting him every morning…she was just so sweet…After a failed attempt to confess her feelings, she finally understands that she can’t be the person Takaki truly desires and make the decision not to tell him how she feels…Kanae’s monologue at the end of the episode was very sad. She talked about how kind Takaki was to her and that she can’t be what he truly wants but she will always helplessly love him. Then she cried herself to sleep…At that moment, my heart broke into pieces…poor Kanae…</p>

        <p>The third and last episode (the shortest one: 10 minutes or so) answered most of my questions but still made me wonder about a few things…The story follows Takaki and Akari. Several years have passed since high school. Takaki is now a grown-up, has a full-time job and a girlfriend, but the sadness of events prior still lingers on. Akari, on the other hand, is planning her marriage. During one scene she is going through some of her old stuff and finds the letter she never managed to give to Takaki, and reminisces that fateful night. I was happy for her, since she seemed to have managed to move on with her life. Takaki on the other hand, just gave up. After his current girlfriend broke up with him, he was unable to deal with his feelings; sadness and loneliness took a hold in his heart and after reaching his limit he quit his job…It is tragic how things turned out for him. It was really a sad moment…In the scene when Takaki and Akari begin the dual narration and the ending soundtrack started, both recalling a dream from that fateful night they had together, tears started to burst out from my eyes. It was something else. It was nostalgic, heart-warming, and sad, as they pass each other on the same place when they were kids. where they made their promise that one day they would see the cherry blossoms again together.</p>
