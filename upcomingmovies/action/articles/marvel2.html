        <p>And just like that Marvel’s Phase Four is underway. For the past couple months, fans have been glued to Disney+’s first MCU series, WandaVision. Along with offering a layered story for Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany’s Vision, the series offered a wink and nod to what’s to come for Brie Larson’s Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel 2. The sequel is going higher, further, faster on our radar after the events of the season, especially in regards to Teyonah Parris’ Monica Rambeau. It’s a great time to check in and talk about what we know about the second solo outing of the Marvel hero.</p>

        <p>As far as Marvel projects go, Captain Marvel is some time away. The movie has not started filming yet and a solid round of movie and television projects are going to be released well before the sequel heads to theaters. Even so, we’ve learned quite a bit about what to expect about the sequel. Here’s a few quick things to know about Captain Marvel 2.</p>

        <p>Captain Marvel will of course see the return of Brie Larson as Carol Danvers in a story that is expected to follow the current timeline of the MCU, as opposed to staying in the ‘90s, where the original told her origins. Joining the cast so far are three other women: Teyonah Parris, Zawe Ashton and Iman Vellani.</p>

        <p>Teyonah Parris will reprise her role as Monica Rambeau after her character was recently introduced in WandaVision. The actress portrays a grownup version of the young daughter of Carol’s fighter best friend, Maria. Parris has previously been in Dear White People, Chi-Raq and If Beale Street Could Talk. Vellani is a brand new actress who was chosen to play Ms. Marvel for the studio. Ashton, who was recently in Velvet Buzzsaw and Greta, is the most recent addition and plays an unknown major character in Captain Marvel 2.</p>

        <p>The release date set for Captain Marvel 2 is November 11, 2022. Assuming the current lineup for Marvel premieres remains the same, it makes Captain Marvel 2 the final Marvel movie to arrive in 2022, following the releases of Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther II. </p>

        <p>The first Captain Marvel movie was directed/written by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the filmmaking team behind It’s Kind of A Funny Story and Half Nelson. For the sequel, Marvel is switching up its talent by handing over the keys to impressive young filmmaker, Nia DaCosta. She will be the first Black woman to helm a Marvel film. DaCosta’s directorial debut was 2018’s Little Woods and she also helmed/co-wrote the upcoming version of Candyman with Jordan Peele. Captain Marvel 2 will be written by Megan McDonnell, who has credits in all nine episodes of WandaVision. It’s very exciting to see the sequel employing a majority of female talent.</p>
