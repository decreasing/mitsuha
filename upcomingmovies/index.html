					<label>REVIEW:</label>
					<span>When The Fast and the Furious first debuted in 2001, it was a simple summer B-movie best described as "like Point Break, but instead of surfing, tricked-out Honda Civics drive under trucks." Yet the heist film, starring a then little-known Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, wildly exceeded box office expectations—and seven sequels later, the Fast & Furious universe has grown in scope, budgets, stunts, and cast size with every release.

After a 1995 adaptation that delivered lukewarm results and its terrible sequel that killed the franchise, 2021’s Mortal Kombat will make the fans of the long-running video game series happy.

					<span>Black Clover is looking forward to its first movie. The anime series recently wrapped up its first original run consisting of a total of 170 episodes. Since then the fans were left with a number of questions. Is the show going on a hiatus or abruptly canceled altogether. Especially to the fact that Manga is still running. So the series aside, Japanese publisher Shueisha Inc came up with an answer.

					<span>Escape Room 2 has been hit with a series of delays, but we will be trapped again in the world's deadliest room in 2022. The first movie might not have been a massive hit with the critics and it seemed as though its cliffhanger ending might have been for nothing. However, it connected with audiences and grossed more than $155 million from only a $9 million budget.

Or, do they pretend to stay together so not to overshadow the couple getting married?
