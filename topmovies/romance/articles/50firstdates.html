        <p>This Valentine opener finds the womanizing Henry (Adam Sandler) trying to win the affection of the beautiful Lucy (Drew Barrymore). Henry is allured to a lasting relationship with Lucy who can no longer lay down short term memory after suffering a severe head injury. Henry, the supreme shallow flirt, finds a real challenge in sweet Lucy as each of their meetings is forgotten and he has to successfully earn her affection each and every day. He is ever resourceful and brings fresh pickup lines to each encounter, bringing laughs with each one.</p>

        <p>The real challenge comes when he truly falls in love with her and begins to actually look for a lasting, meaningful relationship. The obvious difficulty is developing such a relationship when each day must start over from scratch. Despite his one-night-stand skills which have served him well in meeting travelers to his state of Hawaii, Henry must first win over her family and ultimately make a lasting impression on Lucy.</p>

        <p>This movie offers a twist from the typical Hollywood romance where couples are usually in bed barely after a date or two, Henry, because of the newness of each day, is actually unsuccessful in getting Lucy to sleep with him. In fact, as his real love for her grows his lust for her diminishes. There is one mostly-clothed bed scene but sex is not necessarily implied even though they do spend the night together. There are many romantic first kisses however and they do help to show the sex-right-now group that more is not necessarily better. Even Henry seems to grasp this point which would have seemed impossible from early scenes where several women are describing their brief steamy affair with the elusive Henry.</p>

        <p>There are many profanities and fraternity-like references to women, body parts, functions, etc. Amazingly, they are completely unnecessary to the development of what is an otherwise good romance story. Being highly offensive to Christian viewers and completely unnecessary to the enjoyment of any viewer it begs the question of why is that content in there.</p>

        <p>When Lenny’s wife asks him why he missed the shot, Lenny says, “The Baileys needed to learn how to win every once in a while. And the Feders needed to learn how to lose.”</p>

        <p>Of course, laughs are enjoyed along the way, and it is easy to cheer the maturing Henry on towards the development of what may be his first real relationship, a relationship built on the intent to always love and not short-lasting physical attraction. It would be great for Henry to experience the indescribable joys of a meaningful relationship that God has designed.</p>
