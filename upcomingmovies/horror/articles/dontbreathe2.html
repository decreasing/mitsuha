        <p>Don’t Breathe was one of the surprise hits of 2016, starring Stephen Lang as a blind badass battling a trio of thieves, and the actor has now opened up on what we can expect from his return in Don’t Breathe 2.</p>

        <p>Directed by Fede Álvarez, who also helmed the 2013 remake of Evil Dead, the first movie’s plot centers on a group of young housebreakers who hear of a blind Gulf War veteran with a fortune hidden in his home, reasoning that a man who can’t see will be an easy mark. Too late, however, they realize the uncompromising force they’ve pitted themselves against and have to remain as quiet as possible if they hope to escape from the darkened building that their pursuer is far more adept at moving around in.</p>

        <p>Although the first film ended with a hook for a potential continuation, this sequel tells a new story, seeing the Blind Man having taken in a young orphan who’s abducted by criminals, forcing him to hunt them down to get her back, and will potentially rework him as a more heroic character than was suggested by the moral ambiguity that the original brought about by an unpleasant revelation of his intent.</p>

        <p>A critical and commercial smash in 2016, Don't Breathe immediately earned talk of a sequel. For their parts, Alvarez, producer Sam Raimi, and Lang all seemed up to return. Then years went by, with nothing being announced. Now, with a new director onboard, Don't Breathe 2 is at last moving forward.</p>

        <p>Fede Alvarez first confirmed that a sequel was in development in fall 2016. At the time, Alvarez said he planned to return as director, but obviously that ended up not being the case. Around the same time, Sam Raimi talked up Don't Breathe 2, saying Alvarez's sequel idea was the best he'd ever heard. Naturally, this just made fans more eager to see it. By late 2018, Alvarez confirmed a script had been written, but it wasn't until January 2020 that anything concrete emerged. Rodo Sayagues, who co-wrote both Don't Breathe scripts with Alvarez, is taking over as director, and production is slated to begin in April. There's no official release date for Don't Breathe 2 yet, but rumors have suggested a fall 2021 debut is likely, and that the sequel might end up called Don't Breathe Again.</p>

        <p>This far out from its likely release, Don't Breathe 2's plot is being kept mostly under wraps. However, the only confirmed returning cast member is Stephen Lang as The Blind Man, so it seems unlikely Jane Levy's Rocky will make an appearance. It's known that the film will set a few years after the original, and that The Blind Man will be back to living in solitude, at least until his past misdeeds come back to haunt him. Considering what he did in the original film, kidnapping a woman and trying to force her to bear his child, Lang's character certainly has much to atone for.</p>
