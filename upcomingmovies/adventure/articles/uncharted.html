        <p>The Uncharted movie is headed our way after its fair share of speed bumps. The film has been in the works for a while, with multiple directors attached. In fact, Uncharted has been coming together for so long that Mark Wahlberg has gone from playing protagonist Nathan Drake to his older mentor Sully. It's finally almost here, though, and Spider-Man star Tom Holland is set to bring Nathan to the big screen.</p>

        <p>Filming is finished on the Uncharted movie, and it's due to arrive in February 2022, though a one-week delay has pushed it back ever so slightly. But, despite an almost year-long wait, we do know a fair bit about the movie – like casting and plot details, and we also have teaser pictures from the set. Plus, Holland has opened up about playing Nathan Drake and the action we can anticipate when the film hits theaters next year. Scroll on to check out everything there is to know so far about the Uncharted movie.  </p>

        <p>The first Uncharted movie release date was way back in 2016 – suffice it to say, it's been delayed a few times. The most recent delay moved the Holland-led Uncharted flick from February 11 to February 18, 2022. The movie will also be coming to Netflix, too. Thanks to a new deal, Netflix has exclusive rights to stream Sony's theatrical releases – which includes Uncharted, Venom 2, and Morbius. However, these movies won't be on Netflix at the same time as they are in theaters, but will land on the platform within a two-year period after its theatrical release. </p> 

        <p>Despite initial filming having finished, we still do not have an Uncharted movie trailer. We do, however, have our very first image of Tom Holland in the leading role of Nathan Drake. As you would expect, he looks every part the young Indiana Jones. It certainly looks like the Uncharted movie will deliver on the action-adventure front.</p>

        <p>Although there's no trailer, we do have a few official images from the Uncharted movie set. There is a map and a few ancient relics that look straight out of an Indiana Jones movie. Click through the above gallery for more. Spider-Man actor Tom Holland is going from one universally-loved hero to another with Uncharted's Nathan Drake, playing a younger version of the character than seen in the games. Meanwhile, Mark Wahlberg will portray seasoned treasure hunter Victor "Sully" Sullivan, who acts as Drake’s mentor. Dan Trachtenberg, who was set to direct the Uncharted movie until Travis Knight took over (and subsequently left the project), told GamesRadar+ that Holland's Drake would not be as young as fans might assume given the casting. And while Trachtenberg may have left the movie, there’s a large chance his ideas may still be seen on the big screen. </p>

        <p>"[In the Uncharted movie] he might go a little bit older in a way that you realize, 'Oh, it's Nathan before the first game', but it's not like Young Nate Drake,” he said. “He's not playing Nathan in the flashbacks. This is actually just Nathan and Sully's first adventure. Other key cast members include Truth or Dare’s Sophia Taylor Ali, rumored to play Chloe Frazer, a fellow treasure hunter who was introduced in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and led the spin-off Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. The games reveal Frazer has a romantic past with Drake – could the movie show us what happened between the two?</p>

        <p>It's not a coincidence that Uncharted's cast is led by actors considerably younger than the video game characters they portray. The movie will be a prequel to the game series, picking up before the events of the first game, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. It's easy to mistake the boyish Tom Holland as much younger than he really is. Drake’s actually around 30 years old by the time Drake's Fortune kicks off. Holland turned 24 during filming, which lines up relatively nicely as a prequel set a few years before. Likewise, Mark Wahlberg – who turned 49 years old just five days after Holland’s birthday – will play a slightly-younger Sully, who was mid-50s at the time of Drake's Fortune.</p>

        <p>That should clear up a lot of confusion about what timeline the movie is set to follow. This isn't a prequel that explores Drake's early history, but rather the events preceding Drake's Fortune. If there are sequels, there's a good chance they'll either take place in the same timeline as the games or be yet closer to them than the first movie. Holland has recently teased what we can expect from the movie. "Uncharted is a film I finished last year," he told our sister publication Total Film. "It's Mark Wahlberg and myself. It's a prequel to the Naughty Dog game series, Uncharted. I play Nathan Drake. Ruben Fleischer is our director, and he did an amazing job. I'm really chuffed with it. It's fun, it's funny, it's epic. It's going to be really entertaining. The action sequences are some of the coolest sequences that I've ever done. So I'm super-excited about that."</p>
