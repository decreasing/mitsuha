        <p>Black Clover is looking forward to its first movie. The anime series recently wrapped up its first original run consisting of a total of 170 episodes. Since then the fans were left with a number of questions. Is the show going on a hiatus or abruptly canceled altogether. Especially to the fact that Manga is still running. So the series aside, Japanese publisher Shueisha Inc came up with an answer. That turned out to be a Black Clover movie which is currently in the works. Black Clover in the past few years since its debut has established itself among the big anime names and is following strong footsteps ahead.</p>

        <p>Yūki Tabata created Black Clover telling the story of a boy named Asta. He is a young magicless lad born in a world where magic is everything. Despite the setback, he aims to work hard and never give up on his dream of becoming a magic emperor. So anyway, coming back to the Black Clover movie, let’s take a look at everything we know so far about it.</p>

        <p>Black Clover Movie will be released sometime in Mid-2022 in Japan and will make its way to the rest of the world by Fall 2022. The creators of Black Clover currently have no official release date for the Black Clover movie. So even though there is no release date yet, we can predict it owing to the previous anime movies. Particularly, after the announcement, an anime movie takes around 9-12 months to release. So considering that we can expect the Black Clover movie to drop somewhere in early or mid-2022. Even in the late in 2021. But still, there are a few things that needed to be taken a look at. Especially with the ongoing manga and what parts of the manga are Black Clover movies aiming to adapt. So let’s take a look at what we can expect further from the Black Clover Movie.</p>

        <p>The announcement for the Black Clover movie came up with a video teaser. The video showcases a number of arts teased for the movie. But it doesn’t particularly express what the movie will be about.</p>

        <p>The arts in the announcement video come up from the manga itself. Furthermore, the trailer also showcases the utmost popularity Black Clover has managed to grab. Thus resulting in the movie. The announcement came two days before the anime series aired its final episode of the original run. You can check out the announcement teaser video for Black Clover movie below.</p>

        <p>The original plot for Black Clover is set in a world where Magic plays a vital part in the lives of all beings. A boy named Asta is born with no magic in his hands. Still, the fact doesn’t let him down from his dream of becoming a Magic Emperor. Competing head to head with his mate Yuno from the Orphanage hews raised in, Asta eventually becomes part of a Magic Squad named Black Bulls. Step-by-Step he closes on his dreams while also making new friends and family in the process.</p>

        <p>Recently in the anime, the people of the clover kingdom came across the demon residing inside Asta. To clear his name that he is not behind the destruction, Asta promises to hunt down the devil named Megicula. The Black Bulls take the battle to the Demon with the purpose to clear their friend’s name.</p>

        <p>As of now, we are expecting the Black Clover movie to follow in the same footsteps as Demon Slayer. The later one compensated an entire arc into a movie called Demon Slayer: Mugen Train which did huge numbers and continues to do so. Black Clover might also be going on a hiatus for the movie. This may result in Black Clover completing an entire arc in a single movie too.</p>

        <p>Coming from Monsters And Critics, they have predicted that the Black Clover movie may cover up to Chapter 273 approximately. The only problem arising is the arc hasn’t completed yet. It may take 14 more chapters to do so, thus delaying the movie in turn.</p>
