        <p>There’s something inherently beautiful about being transported to a magical world full of unbelievable creatures, awe-inspiring powers, and unforgettable allies. It’s an evergreen fantasy. There are countless anime stories that tap into this energy to varying degrees of success, but the reason that it’s such a staple is there’s something universally appealing about escape. The fantastical empire that’s visited within KonoSuba: God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World isn’t anything wildly original but it thoroughly understands the enticements of the genre. It’s a movie that colors inside of the lines, but it does so with such love that the results are works of art.</p>

<p>Legend of Crimson is basically a 90-minute version of the KonSuba – God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World! anime series. That’s great for viewers who are completely blind to the source material, but for fans who are hungry for new adventures from Kazuma and company, Legend of Crimson is likely to disappoint. Nonetheless the characters remain enjoyable enough that the film amounts to a strong summation of the series.</p>

<p>It also isn’t interested in backstory. This film doesn’t try to fill in the blanks, explain the premise of the series, or cover how Kazuma would up in the KonoSuba world in the first place. This lack of context means that the film can jump right into the action, but it may be jarring for those who have no previous knowledge of the anime. It will take some time for the uninitiated to orient themselves with what exactly is going on. Accordingly, KonoSuba: Legend of Crimson avoids getting lost in the details and tries to trade in fan service as much as possible.</p> 

<p>The KonoSuba series is a part of the fantasy genre that’s set within a magical world that’s full of exciting powers. But in spite of everyone wileding magical powers, this is light fare; a story that wants to be silly and have fun with its characters more than it wants to engage in grueling battle. War and conflict do happen, but this is material that will make you laugh or blush more than it will make you cry. Unfortunately, Legend of Crimson does not have a dub, but the original cast has such chemistry together that this really feels like a bunch of friends on a bizarre quest.</p>

<p>Kazuma and company’s big adventure commences after he receives a letter from Yunyun that demands their attention in the Crimson Demon Clan’s village. The majority of Legend of Crimson is preoccupied with the group’s trip to to the village, their hunt for a powerful weapon, and the complications that they face when an invading chimera general gets in their way. In spite of how danger brings the team over to Megumin’s hometown, there’s a very casual atmosphere that takes up the first half of the film. Hence the heroes spend plenty of time sightseeing and enjoying the creature comforts before any real sense of urgency sets in. Since the Crimson Demon Clan Village is Megumin’s former stomping grounds, she also oddly becomes the film’s guiding force instead of Kazuma.

The movie covers a solid stretch of the anime and it’s fair to say that if you were a fan of the show then you’ll be a fan of this movie adaptation. However, if you actively dislike this lighter fantastical genre of anime, KonoSuba: Legend of Crimson likely won’t be the film to turn you around on the matter. KonoSuba is good at what it does, but there are plenty of series that do the same thing. It also lacks that certain gravitas that’s necessary in a film, resulting in even a strange reliance on insert bumpers throughout the movie to help transition to new scenes.</p>
