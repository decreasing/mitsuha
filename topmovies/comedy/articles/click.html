        <p>"Click" is the story of Michael Newman (Sandler), an up and coming architect whose desire to provide the best life possible for his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and two children often comes at the expense of actually spending time with them.</p>

        <p>One night, after having spent a large sum of money on family presents based upon a promised promotion that doesn't quite happen, Michael ends up in the back room of a Bed, Bath & Beyond store talking to Morty (Christopher Walken), a sort of mad scientist looking fella who seems jovial enough and who just so happens to have received a universal remote that is programmed to remember Michael's every decision and, thus, programs itself to universally control his daily life.</p>

        <p>This universal remote initially appears as quite the gift, as Michael can fast forward through fights with his wife, foreplay before sex, tasks at work, a demanding boss (a hilariously over-the-top David Hasselhoff), dinner with his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner) and a variety of other undesirable responsibilities. However, as the universal remote records more and more of Michael's decisions to "fast forward" he suddenly finds himself missing more and more of his daily life...first days, then months, then the disintegration of his marriage, family and even health.</p>

        <p>Sandler, whose roles in "Spanglish" and "Punch-Drunk Love" garnered critical praise but not much box-office, may give audiences more to like here with a difficult to balance mix of his Sandler brand of sophomoric humor and a sort of confused, but essentially good-hearted, grown-up. Sandler pulls off both roles well, though he's still not quite convincing in scenes requiring him to be distraught/tearful. He comes closer in "Click" to pulling off this sort of scene than I've ever seen, and I have to believe that acting alongside Beckinsale's remarkable authenticity allowed him to let go more fully. It reminded me of the impact Beckinsale had on John Cusack's performance in "Serendipity." Quite simply, she brings out the best in her leading men.</p>

        <p>Ignore the critics. We're going to pick apart "Click" because it doesn't really offer anything new, it doesn't really stretch its actors and it's really not being marketed very effectively. "Click" is a new type of Adam Sandler film that combines the best that Adam Sandler has to offer...his silly, juvenile and sophomoric humor and that grown-up, mixed up but good-hearted man-boy we've all grown to love.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, a film just "clicks." It doesn't really matter what the critics say. This film, well, it's one of those films. Despite all its inherent flaws and challenges, what can I say? It clicks.</p>
