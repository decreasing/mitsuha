        <p>In a snap, Universal was ready to backfill July 2 today with its long-awaited Blumhouse sequel The Forever Purge with the news of Paramount/Skydance’s Top Gun: Maverick leaving the Fourth of July weekend for Nov. 19. The last two Purge movies, 2018’s The First Purge and 2016’s Purge: Election Year played the July 4th corridor.</p>

        <p>The Forever Purge moves up from July 9 to become the lone Independence Day weekend release in the wake of Uni’s June 25 launch of F9 and ahead of Disney’s July 9 release of Marvel’s Black Widow (which now has an easy grab at Imax screens after Top Gun 2‘s flight to November).’</p>

        <p>2018’s The First Purge became the highest-grossing film in the notorious horror series with $137M WW, Blumhouse Productions and Platinum Dunes returns with a terrifying new chapter, written by franchise creator and narrative mastermind James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year).  The Forever Purge is directed by Everardo Gout, writer-director of the award-winning thriller Days of Grace. The film is produced by the series’ founding producers: Jason Blum for his Blumhouse Productions; Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller; and Man in a Tree duo James DeMonaco and his longtime producing partner Sébastien K. Lemercier. The film’s executive producers are Marcei A. Brown, Couper Samuelson and Jeanette Volturno.</p>

        <p>“I think it’s a great way to end it all,” DeMonaco previously told EW. “We want to end it all, I think, in this one, and I’m very excited. When I came up with the idea and pitched it to everybody, they seemed psyched, and I think it will be a really cool ending, how we take this one home.”</p>

        <p>It is quite possible there could be further room for the series to expand, considering how the series has evolved from the simple home invasion story explored in the first film. The thoughtful focus on Latinx characters and its attention to cultural diversity amid bigger issues of class warfare continue to resonate. Whether this is it, or there's more up Blumhouse's sleeves, only time will tell. One thing's for certain, though: After being hunkered down in quarantine for over a year, audiences will be itching to purge once more when The Forever Purge hits theaters this summer.</p>

        <p>Through four movies, the Purge franchise counts $456.8M.</p>
