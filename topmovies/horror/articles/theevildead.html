        <p>The original Evil Dead is considered a genre maker in terms of horror films. It helped created (and disrupted) many of the tropes of the horror genre. Evil Dead is disgusting, hilarious, and a film that will make you jump. And of course, with the release of the remake this weekend, people are talking a great deal about the original Evil Dead from 1981.</p>

<p>The original film’s plot goes something like this. A group of teens (albeit some of the oldest teens we’ve ever seen) go on a trip to their cabin in the woods. And as cliché as this sounds in 2013, remember that this was 1981. Before mainstream slashers and before this was all incredibly stereotypical.</p>

<p>And though the remake looks very different than the original, we think that we can rest assured that the film is in safe hands. Afterall, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are producing it. And the original film made them both legendary in the horror world.</p> 

<p>This story is told with wall-to-wall special effects. Skeletons dance in the moonlight. Heads spin on top of bodies. Hands go berserk and start attacking their owners. After they are chopped off, they have a life of their own. Heads are clamped into vises and squashed. Blood sprays all over everything. Guts spill. Slime spews. If nauseating images of horrific gore are not, as they say, your cup of tea, the odds are good you will not have a great time during this movie.
	
	On the other hand, if you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at "Evil Dead 2." I did - up to a point. The movie devours ideas at such a prodigious rate that it begins to repeat itself toward the end, but the first 45 minutes have a kind of manic, inspired genius to them.
	Consider, for example, the scene where the hero severs his hand from his body and the hand takes on a life of its own, attacking him. Leave out the blood and the gore and a few of the details, and this entire sequence builds like a tribute to the Three Stooges. Consider the scene where the hero attaches a chain saw to what's left of his amputated arm. Disgusting, right? But the director, Sam Raimi, approaches it as a sly jab at the way Robert De Niro armed himself in "Taxi Driver."</p>

<p>There is one shot in the film that is some kind of masterpiece. There is a force out there in the woods. We never see it, but we see things from its point of view. In one long and very complex unbroken point-of-view shot, this force roars through the woods, flattens everything, crashes through the cabin door, and roars through room after room with invincible savagery, chasing the hero until.... But I wouldn't dream of giving away the joke.</p>
