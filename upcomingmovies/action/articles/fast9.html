        <p>When The Fast and the Furious first debuted in 2001, it was a simple summer B-movie best described as "like Point Break, but instead of surfing, tricked-out Honda Civics drive under trucks." Yet the heist film, starring a then little-known Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, wildly exceeded box office expectations—and seven sequels later, the Fast & Furious universe has grown in scope, budgets, stunts, and cast size with every release.</p>

        <p>We're approaching the 20th year of Fast & Furious movies, and there's every reason to believe that Universal Pictures will ride this behemoth 'til the wheels fall off. Our grandchildren may very well ask us to take them to Fast & Furious 26: Brian Marcos Drives in Space one day, and we should honestly be so lucky! That said, after F9: The Fast Saga, the franchise is set to end after F10 and F11. Allegedly.</p>

        <p>After many months of delays, Fast & Furious 9 finally has a true premiere date for June 2021, and a physics-defying new trailer. Two words: "Magnet plane." The extended trailer also shows plenty of its sprawling cast, full of new faces like John Cena as Dominic Toretto's brother, as well as returning ones like Sung Kang's Han (?!?).</p>

        <p>The latest Fast 9 trailer opens with scenes of the gang—sorry, family—reuniting on the farm where Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) now live with Dom's son Brian. They have a great cookout, and then the credits roll.</p>

        <p>Just kidding! The clip's remaining three minutes is a festival of delightful insanity featuring cliff jumps, a magnet plane, and many shots of Cena and Diesel exchanging very intense facial expressions. We get to see a bit more of Han, who's somehow back from his death in Tokyo Drift, and Helen Mirren's character finally gets to drive.</p>

        <p>Originally set to hit theaters on May 22, 2020, it will now premiere on June 25, 2021. The date is still a theatrical release, and there are no plans announced for a simultaneous debut on HBO Max, as Warners is doing with their theatrical releases through the year's end.</p>
