        <p>Escape Room 2 has been hit with a series of delays, but we will be trapped again in the world's deadliest room in 2022. The first movie might not have been a massive hit with the critics and it seemed as though its cliffhanger ending might have been for nothing. However, it connected with audiences and grossed more than $155 million from only a $9 million budget.</p>

        <p>Those are the kinds of numbers that lead to an inevitable sequel and Columbia Pictures quickly confirmed one in February 2019. Adam Robitel is back as director, along with Maria Melnik (who co-wrote the first movie with Bragi F Schut) and producer Neal H Moritz.</p>

        <p>As has been the case with every other movie around in the past year, Escape Room 2's path to the big screen hasn't been a smooth one. There have been numerous release date delays, but it seems that finally we have a confirmed release. When it finally does arrive in cinemas, what can we expect from Escape Room 2?</p>

        <p>The sequel was originally set to hit cinemas on April 17, 2020, before a series of delays saw it pushed back to January 1, 2021 in the US and January 29, 2021 in the UK. Even that one wasn't to be, but Sony eventually confirmed that Escape Room 2 would arrive in cinemas on January 7, 2022 in the US and UK. Here's hoping that release date sticks as the January slot worked so well for the first movie.</p>

        <p>Well, the first movie didn't exactly leave too many characters alive to return for the sequel. Of the six unfortunate people who entered the escape room, only two made it out alive: shy student Zoey (Taylor Russell) and grocery store worker Ben (Logan Miller).</p>

        <p>The official casting announcement confirmed the expected return of Russell and Miller, and they'll be joined by Pose star Indya Moore, Teen Wolf's Holland Roden, Orphan's Isabelle Fuhrman, Carlito Olivero and Thomas Cocquerel.</p>
